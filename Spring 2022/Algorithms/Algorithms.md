# Algorithms
Thursdays one minute before midnight
25% off monday

# Introduction
Three Goals:
1. learn how to measure, test, and analyze the effectiveness of algorithm, program, or data structure
2. present commonly used data structures
3. reinforce the idea of tradeoffs

## Efficiency
* an **efficient** solution is one that solves the problem within the stated resource constraints
* the **cost** of a solution is the amount of resources consumed (space and time)

## Proble
* a **problem** is a task to be performed subject to resource constraints
* the problem definition should not contain any constraints on how the problem should be solved
* problems can be viewed as a specification of inputs and outputs like a math function
* a specific set of inputs is an **instance** of the problem

* an **algorithm** is a process followed to solve a problem
* P
