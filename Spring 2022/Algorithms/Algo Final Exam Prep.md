# Review
* BST vs. Heap
	* How to search, delete
	* What is the difference?
	* Performance Analysis
* Proof of lower bounds
	* Make sure you can replicate this
* P vs. NP
	* at least one question about this

* Sorted array based list vs sorted linked list
	* Unless I tell you otherwise, you don't have to consider resizing for the array based list
	* Insert on a Sorted array list has cost O(n) to put data in the right place
		* Best case O(1)
	* Search cost can be improved by binary search (log(n))
	* There is NO performance increase in using a linkedlist to search
	*
