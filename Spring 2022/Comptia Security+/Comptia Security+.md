1. Confidentiality
	* information must not be shared with other people
	* encryption
2. Integrity 
	* ensuring information has not been modified or altered
	* hashing helps verify this
3. Availability

	* information without availability is useless

## Three A's of security
### Authentication

### Authorization
* when a user is given access to a certain piece of data or certain areas of a building

### Accounting
