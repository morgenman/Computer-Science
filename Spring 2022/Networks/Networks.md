* Syllabus


# Overview
![[Pasted image 20220131102906.png]]
* *Protocols* define the format, order of messages sent and received among network entities, and actions taken on msg transmission, receipt
* **frequency division multiplexing**: different channels transmitted in different bands

* Link Layer vs Network Layer...

* Cell towers ~= 10km range


# Data Transmission
Packets of data of length **L** bits
Transmits into access network at transmission rate **R**
*Link transmission rate* is a metric of bandwidth


*Transmission Delay*
*Propagation Delay*
*Processing Delay*
*Queueing Delay*

*Guided Media*: Signals propagate in solid media (copper, fiber, coax)
*Unguided Media*: Signals propagate freely (radio, wifi)

Message size / 1500 = no. of packets
