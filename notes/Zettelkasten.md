A **Zettelkasten** is a method of note-taking pioneered by [Conrad Gessner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conrad_Gessner) and famously used by [Niklas Luhmann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niklas_Luhmann).[^wiki] The concept revolves around gathering [[Atomic notes|atomic notes]] in a slip box (or a digital equivalent), each uniquely described by an [ID](#ids). These IDs can then be used as referrals or [[Bi-directional links|bi-directional links]] between notes. In its simplest form, a Zettelkasten is a graph where the nodes are notes and the connections are links. The appeal of this process is that connections between knowledge - often never found elsewhere - appear dynamically, allowing for a deeper connection with the topic at hand.

Here is test [[Bibliography]].

## IDs

The IDs used to identify your notes can be whatever you prefer, as long as they are unique. The preferred method for a physical Zettelkasten is to use numbers based on the date and time (e.g. `202003202350`). For software-based Zettelkasten, one could just use the title of the note or a randomly generated ID (like the one in the URL of this page).
