Note: if there is an issue with a dead link, make sure that there aren't too many dashes in the url. Sometimes if I do `note - name` it becomes note---name.html, but the link points to note-name.html (or something like that)

This is my personal [[Zettelkasten]], which means it serves as my knowledge management system. I try too keep these notes as dynamic as possible, but there may crop up some book or lecture notes here and there. Please beware that these notes are for personal use and are probably utterly useless to you. If you do get some use of them, that would make me very happy!

Go ahead and follow any link you want, that should probably lead you down a rabbit-hole into my mind. There's also an index of all the notes contained here, which you can see by looking in the sidebar.
