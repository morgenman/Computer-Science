# [[Operating Systems]]

# [[Professional Practice]]

# [[Theory of Computation]]

Note: if there is an issue with a dead link, make sure that there aren't too many dashes in the url. Sometimes if I do `note - name` it becomes note---name.html, but the link points to note-name.html (or something like that)

These notes follow the [[Zettelkasten]] system, loosly.
