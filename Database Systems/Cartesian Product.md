# Cartesian Product
* Combines information from two relations
* Denoted with **X**
	* eg: instructor X teaches
* constructs tuple of the result out of each possible pair
* If there are duplicate names for attributes, append name of origin before it like: instructor.ID
* Basically, the cross product
* Most likely you should filter this result by the common attribute ([[Primary Key]])
