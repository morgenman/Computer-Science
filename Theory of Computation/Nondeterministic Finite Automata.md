## Combining DFA's to become NFA
* See: ![[RL Closure under Concatenation#NFA Example]]
* NFA does not need to comply to the rule that each input can only have one path. 
* $\mathcal{E}$:  [[Epsilon Transition]] 

## Example: Finite Automata that accepts all strings of form $0^k$ where k is a multiple of 2 or 3
