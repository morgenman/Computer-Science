# Non-Regular Language

* No finite automaton 
* No regular expression
* EG: $0^n1^n$|n>0

## Proof
* $0^n$: Number of states is n+1
* Pumping lemma: Pick a string you want to count, have to make number of states equal to the length
	* Length of string has to be equal to the number of states
* Suppose L is regular
* then M be a finite automaton that recognizes L
* let n be the number of states in M
