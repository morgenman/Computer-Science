Cortana: virtual assistant and AI in Halo
* Female Assistants by default
* Rooted in historical role women have played in the workforce
* 94.2% of secretaries & assistants
* most americans prefer it
* Perpetuates women

* Sexualization of Cortana
	* The only unclothed ai in halo
	* subservient to male commander
	* problematic character

* She is not nude, has neither clothers nor private parts (director)
	* Chooses to appear this way to attract and demand attention

Microsoft has shown us how not to depict a virtual assistant

* ACM Code of ethics
	* 1.1 (does not respect diversity)
	* 1.4 (should not disenfranchise etc)
	* 3.2 (fufillment of social responsibilities)

Natural Language processing and the future
* Synthesizing virtual assistants with digital faces and voices is already possible
* going to become more humanlike

Moral and ethical responsibilities to make sure we aren't perpetuating stereotypes

Maybe we shouldn't anthropomorphize them at all?

Purpose is to drive consumerism

Slides were a little tacky, light blue is a weird color on presentations

# Pawel
Boston Dynamics & terminator
Military applications?
Able to do things just like humans or better
need precautions

Could have practiced a little bit more. Video was a bit choppy. 
Also, Watermark is painful. Window key + G has recording mode, and there are free video editors

I think the distinction between killer robot and AI should be separated. 

# Trevor
GLaDOS
Genetic Lifeform and Disk Operating System

Portal, Deicing purpose
Should the main character trust GLaDOS?

* Stockholm's Syndrome
* When GLaDOS is kidnapped, she hates the birds, but later loves them
* Showing human characteristics

Sounds like a good idea to have an AI 
Scary, if it has a personality

ACM:
avoid harm
trustworthy
system that's secure

Human personality is unpredictable 

She killed all of them

Nice video, good presentation, good video quality. 
AC was on for one point
