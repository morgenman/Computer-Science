Cortana: virtual assistant and AI in Halo
* Female Assistants by default
* Rooted in historical role women have played in the workforce
* 94.2% of secretaries & assistants
* most americans prefer it
* Perpetuates women

* Sexualization of Cortana
	* The only unclothed ai in halo
	* subservient to male commander
	* problematic character

* She is not nude, has neither clothers nor private parts (director)
	* Chooses to appear this way to attract and demand attention

Microsoft has shown us how not to depict a virtual assistant

* ACM Code of ethics
	* 1.1 (does not respect diversity)
	* 1.4 (should not disenfranchise etc)
	* 3.2 (fufillment of social responsibilities)

Natural Language processing and the future
* Synthesizing virtual assistants with digital faces and voices is already possible
* going to become more humanlike

Moral and ethical responsibilities to make sure we aren't perpetuating stereotypes

Maybe we shouldn't anthropomorphize them at all?

Purpose is to drive consumerism

Military applications?
Able to do things just like humans or better
need precautions

Could have practiced a little bit more. Video was a bit choppy. 
Also, Watermark is painful. Window key + G has recording mode

I think the distinction between killer robot and AI should be separated.

* When Glados is kidnapped, she hates the birds, but later loves them
