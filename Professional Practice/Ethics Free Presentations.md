	* Costs associated with these things
	* if concerns are ignored by management, whistleblower
		* high personal cost
* Team Lead
	* more influence, not to steer company
	* Help facilitate the actions that individual developers can take on a greater scale
	* encourage everyone to voice their concerns
	* speak on behalf of the team
		* cost could be to take the 'blame' for pushback
* Senior Developer
	* most direct influence
	* Address all three concerns
	* "listen to those who work for you"
	* Encourage interdepartment communication
	* Get advice about software's suitability for public release
* Ethical course of action for everyone is pretty much the same
