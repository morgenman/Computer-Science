* 37m trip, hands were only on the wheel for 25 seconds
* public beta
* Not a finished polished product. 
* Good Pacing, Nice flow
* Junior Developer
	* least individual influence, greatest collective
	* is code adequately tested?
	* Costs associated with these things
	* if concerns are ignored by management, whistleblower
		* high personal cost
* Team Lead
	* more influence, not to steer company
	* Help facilitate the actions that individual developers can take on a greater scale
	* encourage everyone to voice their concerns
	* speak on behalf of the team
		* cost could be to take the 'blame' for pushback
* Senior Developer
	* most direct influence
	* Address all three concerns
	* "listen to those who work for you"
	* Encourage interdepartment communication
	* Get advice about software's suitability for public release
* Ethical course of action for everyone is pretty much the same
* Personal risks if marginalized individuals is higher
* Cost can change, but ethics are the same

* ACM CoE not conculted when making 'defeat software'
* Nice looking slides, too much reading from the paper, basically just reading the paper

* Corporate Ethics vs ACM Ethics
* Marginalized group shouldn't be a factor?
