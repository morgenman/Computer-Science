* Tesla
* Nice font, clean slides
* Only semi-autonomous, name is confusing (Autopilot)
* 37m trip, hands were only on the wheel for 25 seconds
* public beta
* Not a finished polished product. 
* Good Pacing, Nice flow
* Junior Developer
	* least individual influence, greatest collective
	* is code adequately tested?
	* Costs associated with these things
	* if concerns are ignored by management, whistle blower
		* high personal cost
* Team Lead
	* more influence, not to steer company
	* Help facilitate the actions that individual developers can take on a greater scale
	* encourage everyone to voice their concerns
	* speak on behalf of the team
		* cost could be to take the 'blame' for pushback
* Senior Developer
	* most direct influence
	* Address all three concerns
	* "listen to those who work for you"
	* Encourage inter-department communication
	* Get advice about software's suitability for public release
* Ethical course of action for everyone is pretty much the same
* Personal risks if marginalized individuals is higher
* Cost can change, but ethics are the same
* Nice relaxed pacing

# Pawel
* Volkswagen
* 2006, 'clean diesel'
* used software to cheat emissions
* 40x higher emissions than US standards
* Could not meet these standards
* Driven on a road vs being tested
* Some concerns, involved discussions, told to destroy documents
* If you under perform, you will be replaced
* Code of conduct:
	* promotion of interest
		* make sure opinions don't harm the group
	* silence must be maintained
	* Compliance with rules
* 2.8 billion penalty
* discovered on accident
* ACM CoE not consulted when making 'defeat software'
* Nice looking slides, too much reading from the paper, basically just reading the paper
* too slow, it's several minutes in and you haven't gotten to junior, team, lead section
* Needs to practice more
* Corporate Ethics vs ACM Ethics
* Marginalized group shouldn't be a factor?
* Cost is health risks
* Corporate culture punishes whistle blowers 


# Trevor
* Decent slides, kinda long text across the screen, maybe make text ~60% of the screen, not 90%
* Tesla
* AEB did not brake
* driver didn't take any action

* Good job not looking at notes. Nice relaxed pacing
* Has notes, but doesn't look at them unless you forget something: ðŸ’¯
* CoE: ACM
	* Nice job showing the sections of ACM, a small 2 word summary, and an explanation
	* Very easy to skim
* Public Good, avoid deception, regarding issues
* Unaware if engineer's concerns were addressed
	* (vagueness is bad)
* Junior
	* Explain consequences of public beta testing
	* Reputation when speaking out against Tesla, Loss of Job/trust
* Team Manager
	* stop beta testing
	* costs: loss of job, safety of users, team moral shift
* Lead Programmer
	* Stop testing
	* most impact
	* higher ups looking to change
