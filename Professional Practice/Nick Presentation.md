# Microtargeting

* politicians have always shown different faces to different audiences
	* they want to figure out exactly what people want to hear
	* Mit rohmney, fundraising event with leader or something
	* Mass communication makes this harder to do
	* Rayid Ghani data effort for Obama 2012 campaign
	* Applied advertising tactics	
	* Interviewed thousands of people to group 'like minded' people,  dive into national databases etc to come up with a good campaign
* Sounds like advertisements etc... grouping people into buckets
* Nice slides, decent pacing
* relaxed
