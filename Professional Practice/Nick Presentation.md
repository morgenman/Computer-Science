# Microtargeting

* politicians have always shown different faces to different audiences
	* they want to figure out exactly what people want to hear
	* Mit rohmney, fundraising event with leader or something
	* Mass communication makes this harder to do
	* Rayid Ghani data effort for Obama 2012 campaign
	* Applied advertising tactics	
	* Interviewed thousands of people to group 'like minded' people,  dive into national databases etc to come up with a good campaign
* Sounds like advertisements etc... grouping people into buckets
* Nice slides, decent pacing
* relaxed 
* Value of voter can rise and fall 
* Cambridge Analytica
	* 40 million us voters' FB profiles to rank based on personality traits
	* Republican Jewish Coalition convened in Las Vegas, web advertisements pledging cruz's support to israel were shown exclusively in the hotel
	* very small grained
* Is it ethical to make targeted political advertisements
*
