## Pawel 
* 30k were used in facial recognition test
* no consent given
* tracking how long they looked at advertisements
* Gathered: gender age and whether they matched a list of suspicious persons
* Regular security cameras are ok, but not this	

Looking down at paper
Alignment of hanging text
Mentioned acm guidelines pretty early, but big block of text while he's talking about it. Too much space in between blue line and bullet points
Block of text VSBLTY does not match talking about acm guidelines
Decent eye contact when not reading
No slides after vsblty slide for acm, distracting

## Nick
* TrueAllel
* Gas Robbery, DNA test
* Shirt had 3 dna profiles
* separating out several people's dna
* TrueAllel was 180 quadrillion times more likely to be right
* No third party has evaluated the algorithm
* 'trade secret'

Cover slide jpg quality had some artifacts. 
Good eye contact and pacing
Slides don't distract so far
awesome, love the large text, maybe make the italics and not italics more distinct by mixing up serif and non serif
Not a huge fan of  the font with bullet points. Spacing between bullet points and text needs to be bigger
A little less reading from paper pls
eh font..
I like the slide changes and large font. 
Header lines over points (blue on the left) is weird
a little too many ums
slide with acm 3.7 and 2.1 are not same column size: left is justified, right is hanging
