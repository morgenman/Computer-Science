		* Not preparing what you will have to do on the test
	* don't give up < 15m, don't dally >30m
	* Mistakes only look careless in retrospect
* Attend class
* Studying vs learning
	* Recommend focusing on being able to teach material instead of getting an A

		* learning is the *hows, whys, and the what ifs*
