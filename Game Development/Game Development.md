# Game Development
* Building text-adventure games (3 of them)
* Lots of twine programming
* Final DS Game
* [[Game Loop]]
* Suggestion for Lecture:
	* Go over Semiotics and how it relates to game design. 


## Meaning: Descriptive vs Evaluative 
* Descriptive: 
* Evaluative:
* Meaningful play does not necessarily mean meaningful choices

# 3d Graphics
* vector vs array
* 2d vs 3d
* Vertex:
	* [x y z]
* Matrix
	* [a b c]c
	   [d e f]
	   [g h i]
	* How a vector changes

```
while(t) 
    read input
	update state
	show state
```

# Compression: reducing redundancy


# [[Twine Pitches]]


## Actor?


# ![[Teamwork Agile]]



# Decision Making
## We could use min/max tree
This is a decision space. We try and 





*What is a cellular automata*
* A grid of automata...
* group of states of people in neighborhood is my view?

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| X   |     |     |
|     |     |     |
|     |     |     |

if there's 3 or more neighbors, you turn on
if there's less than 2 neighbors, you are lonely and turn off

So lines of three flip
