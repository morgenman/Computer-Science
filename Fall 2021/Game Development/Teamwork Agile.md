# Teamwork

## What not to do
* probably didn't happen
* Waterfall Model (each level is a pass down, nothing goes back up)
	
* Requirements Document 
	* Design
		* Coders
			* Testers
				* ship it

## What to do
Circle

Requirements -> Design -> Coding -> Testing -> Beginning

# Agile
* Order requirements by how important the requirement is
* how easy it is to implement

* Backlog is a requirements list
	* Use fibbonacci numbers when estimating time?
* It's a feedback loop

# SCRUM
* Correction Factor important
