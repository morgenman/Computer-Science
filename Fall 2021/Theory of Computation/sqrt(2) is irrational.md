# sqrt(2) is irrational
### A number is rational if it is a fraction of form $m/n$, where m and n are integers
### 

## Proof by Contradiction:

**Assume** $\sqrt(2)$ is rational 

sqrt(2) = m/n where m and n are integers

* m and n are divisible by some integer > 1
* reduce fraction:
* if reduced as much as possible, at least one is odd


* sqrt(2)=m/n
* square both sides
* 2 = m^2/n^2
* multiply n^2 on both sides
* 2n^2 = m^2
	* implies m^2 is even 
	* if m^2 is even, m is also even
		* (square of an odd number is always odd)
* Since m is even we can write it as m = 2k

* substitute m into 2n^2 = m^2
* 2n^2 = (2k)^2
* n^2 = 2k^2
* therefore n is even

both m and n are even

which contradicts one having to be odd
