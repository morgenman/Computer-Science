# Set Theory
* Sets
	* An unordered collection of objects
	* Objects are called elements or members
	* Eg: $V=\{a,e,i,o,u\}$
	* Eg: set of perfect squares:
		* $\{n|n=m^2$ for some $m\in \mathbb{N}\}$
	* Union, exclusion, not etc. 
		* In order to do this, we need to know Cardinality
			* Need to know properties of set
	* Union A U B : Elements in both A and B
	* Intersection A n B : Elements in A and B
	* Complement: Not

Sequences and Tuples: A list of objects in order
* tuple is finite sequence

* Power Set is the set of all subsets:
	* A={0,1}
	* P(A)={/0 , {0},{1},{0,1}}


* Cross product or [[Cartesian Product]]
