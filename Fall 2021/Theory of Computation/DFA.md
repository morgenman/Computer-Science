# DFA
* [[Deterministic]] [[Finite Automata]]
* Every state needs to have a transition for every possible input
	* ^^ this is what makes it [[Deterministic]]
* A language that is represented by this is a [[Regular Language]]

## Formal Definition

## Examples 
1.  Suppose $\Sigma=\{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9\}$
	* Design a DFA for languages of strings that have the property that the sum of digits is a multiple of three
	* Going to use `%` operator
	* Three states: modulus is either 0,1,2
		* We accept 0
