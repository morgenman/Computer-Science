# Regular Language
* A language that can be defined by a [[DFA]]
* See also: [[Finite Automata]],
* We can describe a Regular Language using  [[Regular Expression]]s

## Is a regular language if and only if:
1. There is a DFA that accepts all the strings in the language
2. NFA
3. There is some [[Regular Expression]] that describes the language
