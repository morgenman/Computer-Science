# RL Closure under Concatenation

* if A and B are the two regular languages over $\Sigma$ then the concatenation of A and B 
* $AB=\{xy\in\Sigma^* |x\in A$ and $y\in B$
* ![[Pasted image 20210913100220.png]]

## NFA Example
* Where it gets interesting... [[Nondeterministic Finite Automata]]![[Pasted image 20210913100425.png]]
* Accept state of $M_1$ becomes the start state of $M_2$
